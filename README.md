## üê¢ Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)
Like the self-consistency and ToT prompt techniques, ART is a prompting technique that builds on a CoT process. It is specifically used for multi-step reasoning tasks. This technique essentially deconstructs complex tasks by having the model select demonstrations of multiple, or few-shot, examples from the task library. At the same time, the model is using this few shot breakdown, it uses predefined external tools such as search and code gen to carry out the task. Research shows that ART performs substantially better than few-shot prompting and automatic CoT for unseen tasks and matches the performance of handcrafted CoT prompts on a majority of tasks. ART also makes it more efficient for humans to update information in the task libraries, which can correct errors ultimately improve performance
